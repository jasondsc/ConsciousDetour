## Background

## Data


The TaskVGCCode folder contains code to run experiment 3 (i.e., the Eye-tracking experiment). To see the Maze stimuli used for this experiment please see the mazes folder inside this directory.
The preprocess script conatins all the code for preprocessing and analyzing the Eye-tracking data of experiemnt 3. 
The R script Exp3_behaviour_analysis contains all of the analyses related to experiment 3.
The Plotting_VGC_maze script contains all the code necessary to visualize the maze stimuli and test for differences in nuissance covariates. This script requires the vgc python package. 

The E-life_review script contains all of the additional analyses included in the revised version of the manuscript.
